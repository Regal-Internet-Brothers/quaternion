# quaternion
A basic quaternion implementation, written with the [Monkey programming language](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey).

This was written using [this repository](https://github.com/MauriceGit/Quaternion_Library) as a rough guide. This looks very little like that version, but it was definitely a useful reference.
